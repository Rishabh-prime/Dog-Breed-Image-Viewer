- A web browser
- Internet connection

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

### Notes:
- Replace placeholders like `yourusername`, `your_api_key_here`, `link-to-screenshot1`, `your-email@example.com`, etc., with your actual data.
- If your project does not require a `.env` file and directly includes the API key in the code (which is not recommended for security reasons), adjust the instructions accordingly.
- Add any other relevant information that might be useful for users or contributors.
